# Work example

*For the time I did not update readme file output could change*
However, test.txt is:
```
hello
"1234"
145
5.425
```

and output is:
```
Type: SYMBOLPLUS  Symbol: hello  Line: (1,1)
Type: STRING      Symbol: 1234   Line: (2,1)
Type: INTEGER     Symbol: 145    Line: (3,1)
Type: RATIONAL    Symbol: 5.425  Line: (4,1)
```
